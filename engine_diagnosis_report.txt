Generated: 2025-11-16T05:35:41

ANALYSIS RESULTS:
- Total phase coupling points: 0
- Maximum coupling strength: 0.000
- Strong couplings (>0.9): 0

DIAGNOSIS:
- Status: NORMAL
- Details: No significant phase coupling detected. Engine operating normally.

PHASE COUPLING INTERPRETATION:
- Normal engine: Random phase relationships, few/no couplings
- Abnormal engine: Synchronized phases, strong couplings at specific frequencies
- Your results indicate: No significant phase coupling detected. Engine operating normally.
